Generate a slow, atmospheric sequence inspired by gothic rock. Use long, sustained notes and dark, minor harmonies. The rhythm should feel heavy and spacious, with silence and repetition creating a sense of emptiness and longing. Keep the dynamics low and restrained, letting the music evolve gradually. Focus on tension and release within a minor tonal center, evoking a mood of melancholy and isolation.
