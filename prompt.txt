Create a slow, atmospheric ambient piece. Use long, sustained notes with gentle overlaps. Focus on consonant intervals like fifths and octaves. Let notes breathe with space between phrases. Think Brian Eno's "Music for Airports" or Harold Budd - sparse, floating, meditative. Avoid rhythmic patterns - instead, create a drifting, timeless quality. Use soft velocities and let notes ring out naturally. Evolution should be glacial - barely perceptible changes over many loops.
